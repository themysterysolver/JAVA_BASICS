/*Polymorphism tells that during a  object creation,
  ref varaible and object can be of different types such that object is a subclass and ref var is supertype*/
  //object IS-A reference variable
//this agree with arguments,return values also!!
//referenc variable of superclass!
//we can't extend any class private,final,those not in same package even if it's public
//OVERRIDING:-same arguments and return types,can't be less acessible!!
//OVERLOADING:-new arguments of diff types can be added,return type can be be different iff arguments have changes,vary access modifiers
